# Important Tools for Ethical Hackers

## Note-Taking Tools

### Keep Note
* Cross-platform tool (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)
* Hierarchical organization system
* Good for organizing commands, outputs, and screenshots
* Available at keepnote.org
* Not updated frequently but still very functional

### Flame Shot (Linux)
* Linux alternative to Green Shot
* Similar functionality
* Recommended for Linux users

## Virtual Machines

### Purpose of Virtual Machines
* Running operating systems within your main OS
* Creating isolated environments for testing
* Building labs without needing physical hardware
* Running multiple operating systems simultaneously
* Industry standard for penetration testing

### Virtual Machine Software
* VirtualBox (free)
* VMware (commercial, some free versions available)

### Common VM Setups for Ethical Hacking
* Running Kali Linux as a VM on Windows/Mac
* Creating isolated networks for testing
* Building Active Directory labs

### Resource Considerations
* VMs can be resource-intensive
* Recommendations:
  * At least 8GB RAM for basic setups
  * 16GB+ RAM for Active Directory labs
  * Sufficient disk space for multiple VMs

## Installation Process

The instructor demonstrates:
1. Installing Keep Note (simple next-next-finish process)
2. Installing Green Shot (simple next-next-finish process)
3. Configuring Green Shot to start with Windows
4. Using Green Shot to capture screenshots
5. Editing screenshots (adding borders, inverting colors, highlighting)
6. Integrating screenshots into notes

## Recommendation
"If I had to make two recommendations for your note keeping, it's Keep Note and Green Shot. If I had to make one recommendation of the two, it's absolutely Green Shot. You can be flexible on your note keeping tool."
