# Installing Kali Linux (1:52:19)

## Overview
This section covers the process of installing Kali Linux as a virtual machine, which is essential for the lab environment in this ethical hacking course.

## What are Virtual Machines?
- A VM (Virtual Machine) is a machine running on top of another machine
- Allows running multiple operating systems simultaneously without additional hardware
- Used daily by penetration testers to separate testing environments from host systems
- Resource consideration: 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB+ recommended especially for Active Directory labs

## Installation Process
1. Download Kali Linux from the official website
2. Import into your virtualization software (VMware or VirtualBox)
3. Allocate appropriate resources:
   - CPU cores
   - Memory (RAM)
   - Disk space

## Virtualization Software Options
- VMware (Workstation Pro/Player for Windows, Fusion for Mac)
- VirtualBox (Free, cross-platform alternative)
- Both support Kali Linux effectively

## Why Use Kali Linux?
- Pre-loaded with hundreds of security tools
- Designed specifically for penetration testing and security assessments
- Regular updates with the latest security tools
- Industry standard for ethical hacking

## Benefits of Virtual Machines for Security Testing
- Isolation from your main operating system
- Snapshots for easy rollback after testing
- Ability to create networks of multiple machines
- Portable lab environments that can be moved between computers

## Hardware Requirements
- Minimum: 8GB RAM, dual-core processor
- Recommended: 16GB+ RAM, quad-core processor, SSD storage
- More resources needed when running multiple VMs simultaneously

## Post-Installation Steps
- Update Kali Linux with latest patches
- Configure network settings
- Customize the environment as needed
