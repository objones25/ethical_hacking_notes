# Utilizing Social Media for OSINT

## Introduction to Social Media OSINT

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) via social media platforms provides valuable information about organizations and employees that can be leveraged during security assessments.

## LinkedIn as an OSINT Source

LinkedIn provides rich information about organizational structure, employees, and sometimes even technologies used.

### Gathering Information from LinkedIn
- Company pages reveal organizational structure
- Employee profiles indicate technologies, projects, and team structures
- Job listings expose technology stacks and internal systems
- Company photos might reveal security badges or office layouts

### LinkedIn OSINT Techniques
1. Search for the target company
2. Review the "Images" section for employee photos
3. Look for security badges visible in images
4. Note employee names and positions
5. Document naming conventions from email addresses
6. Build organizational charts
7. Extract technology information from job descriptions

## Twitter as an OSINT Resource

Twitter is often a goldmine for operational security failures and information leakage.

### Twitter OSINT Techniques
1. Search for the company's official account
2. Search for employees mentioning the company
3. Look for tweets with images from the workplace
4. Search for technology-related tweets from employees
5. Monitor company hashtags
6. Look for complaints or support issues that might reveal internal processes

### Common Findings on Twitter
- Office photos showing monitors/screens with sensitive information
- Security badge pictures
- Complaints about internal systems or technologies
- Mentions of ongoing projects or releases
- Photos of whiteboards or sticky notes with credentials

## Practical Applications for Penetration Testing

### Employee Enumeration
- Build a list of employees from social media profiles
- Convert to potential username formats (firstname.lastname, flastname, etc.)
- Use for password spraying or phishing campaigns

### Email Formatting Confirmation
- Link social media discoveries with previously identified email formats
- Test formats against authentication systems
- Use for targeted phishing or social engineering

### Badge Cloning
- Photos of badges can reveal access control technologies
- Badge designs can be replicated for physical penetration tests
- Details visible on badges may include access levels or departments

### Technology Stack Identification
- Employee profiles often list technologies used
- Job postings reveal internal systems and software
- Technical discussions may expose vulnerabilities or configurations

## Ethical and Professional Considerations

- Always operate within the scope of your engagement
- Do not contact employees directly unless authorized
- Respect privacy and only collect publicly available information
- Document findings professionally without personal judgments
- Report exposed sensitive information to the client promptly
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
