# A Day in the Life of an Ethical Hacker

## Daily Activities
The typical day of a penetration tester includes:
1. Performing assessments
2. Writing reports
3. Delivering debriefs to clients
4. Some combination of all three

## Types of Assessments

### External Network Penetration Testing
* Most common type of penetration test
* Assesses an organization's security from the outside
* Simulates an attacker trying to breach from external networks
* Methodology focuses heavily on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering
* Looks for login panels, user information, and ways to breach the perimeter
* Common because:
  * Compliance requirements often mandate annual external tests
  * Usually less expensive than other assessments
  * Good starting point for organizations new to security testing
* Typically lasts 32-40 hours (8-16 for very small engagements) plus 8-16 hours for report writing

### Internal Network Penetration Testing
* Assesses an organization's security from inside the network
* Simulates an attacker who has already breached the perimeter
* Often performed remotely by sending a laptop to the client
* Methodology focuses heavily on Active Directory attacks
  * "95-99% of Fortune 500 companies use Active Directory"
  * Nearly every internal pen test involves Active Directory
* Typically lasts 32-40 hours plus 8-16 hours for report writing

### Web Application Penetration Testing
* Second most common type of assessment
* Tests security of websites and web applications
* Methodology follows OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) testing guidelines
* OWASP top 10 attacks knowledge is essential for web app pen testers
* Typically lasts 32-40 hours plus 8-16 hours for report writing

### Wireless Penetration Testing
* Assesses wireless network security
* Methodology varies depending on network type:
  * Guest networks: Testing segmentation
  * Pre-shared key networks: Testing password strength
  * Enterprise networks: Various advanced attacks
* Relatively straightforward to learn with affordable equipment
* Typically lasts 4-8 hours per SSID plus 2-4 hours for report writing

### Physical Penetration Testing & Social Engineering
* Tests physical security and human factors
* Can involve badge cloning, lock picking, social engineering
* Methodology depends on client goals (just get in the building, reach server room, etc.)
* Often combines with social engineering campaigns:
  * Phishing emails
  * Phone calls posing as IT
  * SMS-based campaigns (smishing)
* Provides excellent training opportunities with video recording
* Can last 16-40+ hours plus 4-8+ hours for report writing

### Other Specialized Assessments
* Mobile penetration testing (iOS, Android)
* IoT (Internet of Things) testing
* Red team engagements (more open-ended, stealthy attacks)
* Purple team exercises (red + blue team collaboration)
* Car hacking, airplane hacking, SCADA testing, etc.

## Report Writing
* Reports are typically delivered within a week after the engagement
* Should include both high-level and technical content:
  * Executive summary for non-technical leadership
  * Technical findings section for engineers and developers
  * Clear recommendations for remediation at both levels
* Report writing is a skill that improves with practice and feedback

## Debriefing Process
* Walks clients through report findings
* Needs to be accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences
* Allows clients to ask questions and address concerns
* Final opportunity for clients to provide input before report finalization
* Requires good presentation and communication skills

## Important Skills for Success
To be a successful consultant/ethical hacker requires three key skills:
1. Technical abilities
2. Report writing and communication skills
3. Presentation skills

These skills improve with experience, but are essential to master for long-term success in the field.
