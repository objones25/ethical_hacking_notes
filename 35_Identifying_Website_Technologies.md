# Identifying Website Technologies

## Why Technology Identification Is Important

- Helps identify potential vulnerabilities specific to technologies being used
- Provides insight into an organization's tech stack
- Reveals software versions that might be outdated and exploitable
- Understanding backend technologies guides your attack approach

## Using BuiltWith

BuiltWith is a web service that identifies technologies used on websites.

### How to Use BuiltWith
1. Navigate to https://builtwith.com
2. Enter the target domain (e.g., tesla.com)
3. Review the detailed technology breakdown

### Information Provided by BuiltWith
- Content Management Systems (CMS) like Drupal, WordPress
- Programming languages (PHP, JavaScript, etc.)
- Server technologies (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- Third-party services and integrations
- Analytics and tracking tools
- Payment processors
- CDN information
- JavaScript frameworks and libraries

## Using Wappalyzer Browser Extension

Wappalyzer is a browser extension that identifies technologies used on websites you visit.

### Installation
- Available for Firefox and Chrome
- Install from browser extension store

### Using Wappalyzer
1. Visit the target website
2. Click on the Wappalyzer icon in the browser toolbar
3. View the categorized list of detected technologies

### Advantages of Wappalyzer
- Real-time analysis as you browse
- Categorized technology detection
- Often detects version numbers
- Provides a clean, organized interface

## Using whatweb (Command Line Tool)

Whatweb is a built-in Kali Linux tool for website fingerprinting.

### Basic Usage
```bash
whatweb https://example.com
```

### Information Provided by whatweb
- Server software and versions
- CMS detection
- JavaScript libraries
- Web frameworks
- Server headers
- IP addresses
- Other technical details

### Example Output
For a site running Drupal:
```
https://example.com [200 OK] Apache, Cookies, Country[UNITED STATES][US], Drupal, HTML5, HTTPServer[Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)], IP[93.184.216.34], JQuery, Meta-Author[Drupal], PHP[7.2.24], Script, Title[Example], X-Powered-By[PHP/7.2.24]
```

## Tactical Application

### Why Technology Identification Matters
- Outdated versions often have known vulnerabilities
- Certain technologies have common misconfigurations
- Libraries and frameworks may have security issues
- CMS platforms like Drupal, WordPress have plugin vulnerabilities
- Understanding the stack helps you focus your testing efforts

### Next Steps After Identification
1. Research known vulnerabilities for identified technologies
2. Check version numbers against CVE databases
3. Look for common misconfigurations in the technology stack
4. Test for default credentials or admin interfaces
5. Target testing to the specific technologies in use
